# Philosophers.
Iâ€™ve never thought philosophy would be so deadly.


I spent, like, one hour researching info on semaphores only to figure out that it can be summarized in one sentence. It's a BDO auction. You can post an item there, or you can wait for an item from there. If there're 0 items, you can't go on without it. Easy.
